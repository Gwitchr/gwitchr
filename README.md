### Hi there 👋, my name is Luis Casillas

I mainly work as a Developer, mostly frontend, I'm a big fan of tech and have been coding for over 5 years now. 

🔭 Nowadays I work on different projects accross industries, that are built primarily on Nextjs, express, and are written primarily in TypeScript, styled in many ways with CSS, SASS, styled componenys, TailwindCSS, ChakraUI or ReactStrap and state managed in various ways (Redux/React-query/Context). Tested with React-Testing-Library and deployed to the web through cloud based services.  

🧮 I've also taught (but most of the time, to be honest, **learnt** while doing it) about the web, its languages and JS driven backend/frontend with tools such as express, React, TypeScript, Redux, Testing-Library, etc [@Devf.la](https://github.com/devfmx)
  
🌱 Currently I'm in the process of getting certified as a MongoDB Developer

⚡️ Fun fact: I have a B.A. in Product Design 🏴‍☠️
