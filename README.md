### Hi there 👋, my name is Luis Casillas

I mainly work as a Developer, mostly frontend, I'm a big fan of tech and have been coding for some years now. 

🔭 Nowadays I work on _Online Ordering_ (OLO for short) which is a digital product built with React and written in TypeScript, that leverages the React ecosystem (Redux/Thunks/etc) by **SpotOn!** that helps merchants in the US sell online without much hassle. 

🧮 I also teach (but most of the time, to be honest, **learn**) about the web and JS driven backend/frontend [@Devf.la](https://github.com/devfmx) 
  
🌱 Currently I'm in the process of getting certified as a MongoDB Developer

⚡ Fun fact: I actually have a B.A. in Product Design 🏴‍☠️
