### Hi there 👋, my name is Luis Casillas

I mainly work as a Developer, mostly frontend, I'm a big fan of tech and have been coding for some years now. 

🔭 Nowadays I work on _Online Ordering_ (OLO for short) which is a digital product built with React and written in TypeScript by **SpotOn!** that helps merchants in the US sell online without much hassle. 

🧮 I also teach (and learn most of the time, honestly by it) about the web and JS backend/frontend [@Devf.la](https://github.com/devfmx) 
  
🌱 Currently I'm in the process of getting certified as a MongoDB Developer

⚡ Fun fact: I actually have a B.A. in Product Design 🏴‍☠️
