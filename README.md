### Hi there 👋, my name is Luis Casillas

I usually work as a Developer, mainly frontend, I actually have a B.A. in Product Design 🏴‍☠️, but I'm a big fan of tech. 

🔭 Nowadays I work on _Online Ordering_ (OLO for short) which is a digital product built with React and written in TypeScript by **SpotOn!** that helps merchants in the US sell online without much hassle. 
  
🌱 Currently I'm in the process of getting certified as a MongoDB Developer
